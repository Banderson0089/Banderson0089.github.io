								<h2><a href="#">Mock Proposal</a></h2>
								<p>I am currently employed by a local electrical utility company that needs to improve the current electrical grid by installing a new permanent electrical substation. 
									This substation will convert high-voltage electricity into lower-voltage electricity for use by electrical customers, 
									meeting current and future demand while supporting system reliability and redundancy. 
									Site #1 was initially selected for its proximity to existing high-voltage transmission lines, technical feasibility, and cost-effectiveness. 
									However, public input introduced three additional alternative sites (#3, #7, #11) to be analyzed for potential visual impacts,
									 as the proposed site is located on land administered by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM).

									To determine the visual impacts of each alternative site, I used the Visibility Analysis toolset within ArcGIS. 
									I created a viewshed raster file utilizing digital elevation models (DEM) from the National Elevation Dataset (NED) and mapped each site. 
									Each alternative substation site and the required new high-voltage transmission line construction were represented by polygon and line shapefiles, respectively. 
									Using ESRI ArcGIS software, I ran the NED raster data through various tools to create visibility models. For each site, observation points were created, 
									and the visibility tool was used to model what areas can see the substation and what can be seen from the substation. 
									Additional visibility models were created for the new transmission lines required for sites #3 and #11. 
									A 3-mile radius buffer was used for substation sites and a 5-mile radius for transmission lines to determine the number of impacted private land parcels. 
									The results of these analyses, which showed Site #3 as the least visible and Site #11 as the most impactful due to the required transmission line, 
									will be used as part of the Environmental Assessment (EA) for the BLMs review of the project.
